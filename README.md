# Leap-year-finder
Leap Year Finder is a simple yet efficient program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. It’s designed to help beginners understand basic programming concepts such as conditional statements, user input, and logical operations.

A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.

For example,

1999 is not a leap year
2000 is a leap year
2004 is a leap year
